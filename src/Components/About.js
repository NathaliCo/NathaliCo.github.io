One of my favorite activities, besides literature, is to learn new things, which is why I decided to enter to the tech world. My long-term goal is to be able to generate social change through my code. I am interested in being updated on new technologies, so I look for a place where I can continue developing my skills and abilities as a web developer. Although my first approach with the programming has been in front end, I would like later to learn about back-end technologies. </span>
